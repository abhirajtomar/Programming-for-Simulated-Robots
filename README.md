Programming-for-Simulated-Robots
================================

The project is divided into 3 parts : Project 1, 2 and 3.

Project 1: Designs and implements a simple robot Rx to move from point A to point B in an open environment.

Project 2: Gives Rx intelligence so that it can search and navigate a path from point A to point B in a crowded environment. A-Star graph search is used by Rx for searching the optimal path.

Project 3:Makes Rx learn from its own experience so that it can find a target in its crowded environment quickly.
